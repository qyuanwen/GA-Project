    "### Problem Statement and Solution Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**<br>\n",
    "Despite ongoing efforts to improve the MRT system, train delays and faults persist, causing frustration and inconvenience for passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposed Solution:**<br>As a daily commuter of Singapore MRT, I aim to develop a train delays predictor that can identify stations and timings that are more likely to experience breakdowns or delays. \n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing historical data on time of day, type of day, station name, commuter volume, and breakdown/non-breakdown indicators, I hope to create a model that can accurately predict future breakdowns and help commuters avoid stations and times with potential delays."
